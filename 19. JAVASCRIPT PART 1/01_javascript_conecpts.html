    Data Types in JS
        • Primitive Types
          • Number : -ve, +ve, decimal
          • Boolean
          • String
          • Undefined
          • Null
          • Bigint
          • Symbol

    Operations in JS
        a = 20
        b = 10
        //addition
        sum = a + b
        // subtraction
        diff = a -b
        //multiplication
        prod = a * b
        //division
        div = a / b
        • Modulo (remainder operator)
        12 % 5 = 2
        • Exponentiation (power operator)
        2 ** 3 = 8

    NaN in JS
        The NaN global property is a value representing Not-A-Number.
        0 / 0
        NaN - 1
        NaN*1
        NaN + NaN

    Operator Precendence
        This is the general order of solving an expression.
        ()
        ** -> Power Operator
        *, /, % -> Left to Right order 
        +, -

    let keyword
        Syntax of declaring variables
        let age = 23 ;
        age : age + 1 ;
        let numl = 1;
        let num2 = 2;
        let sum = numl + num2 ;
        let cgpa ;
        cgpa = 8.9
   </div>
   <div>
    const keyword
        values of constants can't be changed with re-assignment & they can't be re-declared
        const year = 2025;
        year = 2026             //Error
        year = year + 1         //Error
        const pi = 3.14 ;
        const g : 9.8 ;
   </div>
   <div>
    var keyword
        Old Syntax of writing variables
        var age = 23 ;
        var cgpa = 8.9 ;
        var numl = 1;
        var num2 = 2;
        var sum = numl + num2 ;
   </div>

    Assignment Operators
        age = age + 1
        age += 1
        age = age - 1
        age -= 1
        age = age * 1
        age *= 1
   </div>
   <div>
     Unary Operators
          age = age + 1
          age = age - 1
          age += 1
          age += 1

          // increment
          age++ 
          // decrement
          age--

     Pre-increment (Change, then use)
          let age = 10 ;
          let newAge = ++age ;
     Post-increment (Use, then change)
          let age = 1O ;
          let newAge = age++ ;

     Identifier Rules
          All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names (identifiers).

          • Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs. (no space)
          • Names must begin with a letter.
          • Names can also begin with $ and _.
          • Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
          • Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) CANNOT be used as names.
   </div>
   <div>
     camelCase
          Way of writing identifiers
          • cameCase (JS naming convention)
          • snake-case
          • PascalCase
   </div>
   <div>
     What is TypeScript?
          Static Typed, where JS is dynamic typed -> datatype of a variable can be changes in dynamic typed
          Designed by Microsoft

   <div>
     String in JS
          Strings are text or sequence of characters
          let name = "Tony Stark" ;
          let role = 'ironman' ;
          let char = 'a' ;
          let num = '23' ;
          let empty = "",
   </div>
   <div>
     String Indices
          let name = "TONY STARK" ;
          name[O] 'T'
          name[l] '0'
          name.length -> length of string named name
   </div>
   <div>
     Concatenation
          adding strings together
          "tony + "" + "stark" = "tony stark"
          "tony" + 1 "tonyl"
   </div>

     null & undefined in JS
     • undefined
          A variable that has not been assigned a value is of
          type undefined.

     • null
          The null value represents the intentional absence of
          any object value.
          To be expliciy assigned.
