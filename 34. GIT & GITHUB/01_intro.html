        What is Git?
            Free & Open Source Version Control System
            tools that help to tracks changes in code
    </div>
    <div>
        What is Github?
            Website where we host repositories online
    </div>
    <div>
        Using Git
            • Command Line (Most Popular)
            • IDE I Code Editors (like VSC0de)
            • Graphical User Interface (like GitKraken)
    </div>
    <div>
        Configuring Git
            git config --global user.name "My Name"
            git config --global user.email "someone@email.com"
    </div>
    <div>
        Basic Commands
            • Clone - Cloning a repository on our local machine git clone <- some link ->
            • status - displays the state of the code -- git status
    </div>
    <div>
        Basic Commands
            • add - adds new or changed files in your working directory to the Git staging area.
                git add <- file name ->
            • commit - it is the record of change
                git commit -m "some message"
            • push - upload local repo content to remote repo
                git push origin main
    </div>
    <div>
        Basic Commands
            • init- used to create a new git repo -- git init

            git remote add origin <-link->
            git remote -v (to verify remote)
            git branch (to check branch)
            git branch -M main (to rename branch)
            git push origin main
    </div>
    <div>
        Branch Commands
            git branch (to check branch)
            git branch -M main (to rename branch)
            git checkout <- branch name -> (to navigate)
            git checkout -b <- new branch name -> (to create new branch)
            git branch -d <- branch name -> (to delete branch)
    </div>
    <div>
        Merging Code
            git diff <- branch name->   (to compare commits, branches, files & more)
            git merge <- branch name->   (to merge 2 branches)
            OR
            Create a PR

        Pull Request
            It lets you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.
        
        git pull origin main
            used to fetch and download content from a remote repo and immediately update the local repo
            to match that content.
    </div>
    <div>
        Merge Conflicts
            An event that takes place when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code
            between two commits.
    </div>
    <div>
        Fixing Mistakes
            Case 1 : staged changes
                git reset <- file name ->
                git reset
            Case 2 : commited changes (for one commit)
                git reset HEAD-1
            Case 3 : commited changes (for many commits)
                git reset <- commit hash ->
                git reset --hard <- commit hash ->
    </div>
    <div>
        What is Forking?
            A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original "upstream"
            repository.
            Fork is a rough copy.
