        Object Oriented Programming
        To structure our code
        • prototypes
        • New Operator
        • constructors
        • classes
        • keywords (extends, super)

        Object Prototypes
        Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another.
        It is like a single template object that all objects inherit methods and properties from without having
        their own copy.

        arr._proto_ (reference)
        Array.prototype (actual object)
        String.prototype

        every object in JavaScript has a built-in property, which is called its prototype, The prototype is
        itself an object, so the prototype will have its own prototype, making what's called a prototype
        chain. The chain ends when we reach a prototype that has nutt for its own prototype.

        Factory Functions
        A function that creates objects

        New operator
        The new operator lets developers create an instance of a user-defined object type or of one of
        the built-in object types that has a constructor function.

        Classes
        Classes are a template for creating objects
        The constructor method is a special method of a class for creating and initializing an
        object instance of that class.

        Inheritance
        Inheritance is a mechanism that allows us to create new classes on the basis of already existing classes.
