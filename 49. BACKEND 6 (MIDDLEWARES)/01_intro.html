        What do middlewares do?

        Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:
        Execute any code.
        Make changes to the request and the response objects.
        End the request-response cycle.
        Call the next middleware function in the stack.
    </div>
    <div>
        Using next
        The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.

        If the current middleware function does not end the request-resoonse
        cycle, it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function.
