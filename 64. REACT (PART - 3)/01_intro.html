        State in React
        The state is a built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component.
        A component's state can change over time; whenever it changes, the component re-renders.

        Hooks
        Hooks were a new addition in React 16.8.
        They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.

        useState( )
        useState is a React Hook that lets you add a state variable to your component.
        const [state, setState] = useState(initialState) ;
        useState returns an array with exactly two values:
        l. The current state. During the first render, it will match the initial State you have passed.
        2. The set function that lets you update the state to a different value and trigger a re render.
